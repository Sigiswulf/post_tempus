 lost_expedition_desc:0 "When Mitterrand seized emergency powers, he had promised to use them to restore stability and to present a permanent solution the raiders problem. Mobilizing entire swathes of Southern France, the newly formed Army of the Rhine was to march up into Picardy, and wipe out the bandits squatters once and for all.\n\n Except the complete opposite happened. Mobilized on such short notice and operating on the tightest of schedules, the Army of the Rhine was faced with logistical struggles from the first day, and the legion of conscripts began to gradually whittle down to nothing, lost to either attrition or defected at the first opportunity. When they finally met the bandits of Picardy at Metz, l'Armee de Terre was handed a decisive defeat at the hand of simple bandits, echoing the defeat of a past France. \n\n When the news finally made its way back home, the Picardy Expedition returned with only barely a third of the men it had set out with, and behind them, the bandits chased them all the way into the heart of France. And when the report arrived at Mitterrand's desk, the words he uttered would be forever ingrained in the collective memories of Southern France: \n\n "We shall return to Picardy, and this time we shall be victorious."\n\n Mitterrand had forgotten, but the South remembers well."
