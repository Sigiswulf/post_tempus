#FIFTH FRENCH REPUBLIC
  POLITICS_FRANCOIS_MITTERAND_DESC:0 "It was all supposed to work so well. For a decade the Fifth Republic had dragged itself from one year until the next, mortally wounded yet still alive. \n\n Then the elections, yes, elections of 1985 had delivered Mitterand himself to office.  When everything fell apart at once, almost immediately after the elections, he could only wonder if there was something he could have done to save what little remained of the Republic. \n\n Declaring marital law amid the chaos of ’86 and ’87, and claiming emergency powers for himself, Mitterand had done just that in the decades since, holding the delicate remanent of the pre-war French government around himself, keeping what remained from falling into the anarchy that had claimed southern France. \n\n But that does not mean anyone holds him in any great regard. The presidential dictatorship wears on the patience of the populace, and the Normandy Expedition, the last act approved by the senate before Mitterrand seized emergency powers, grows only more hopeless as the quagmire continues without an end in sight.  \n\n The fact that Mitterrand himself had escalated what was already the undeniable cause behind the present collapsing state of the economy and the escalating banditry in the South merely to appease the military has not been forgotten by any. \n\n Now, Mitterrand sits atop a wobbly house of cards, stuck in the middle, desperately grasping at every straw to keep what remained of the patchwork government of the Fifth Republic alive. And perhaps the writing was already on the wall. \n\n Perhaps the Republic was never meant to survive, and all he had done was to delay its agonizing end."

  POLITICS_FABIEN_ANCEL_DESC:0 "When the bombs fell, civilization and with it any possibility for a peaceful childhood were washed away under waves of flames. For those left behind in the ruins, life was a competition, a competition to see who could accumulate the most food and clothes, and the only score keeper was the hearse, dragging those who had failed. \n\n And amid it all, Fabien Ancel had clawed his way to the top. From a petty thief fighting tooth and nail to steal pieces of bread from equally desperate refugees to the “Menace of the Lowlands”, sitting atop the final evolution of his gang of deplorables - the Black Horde of Picady. To strike fear in all those around them and to fill their pockets with the glorious loot of their raids, such was their lot in life, and few in the bandit army would want it any other way. \n\n But Fabien is an ambitious man, one that cannot be satisfied with merely sitting a top a rowdy gang of bandits. If bandits could secure a state better than the regimes of old, then bandits should rule, and any who could overpower the other and take their loot deserves to lord over the others - after all, this had worked for him. \n\n And to Fabien, what worked for him, can work for anyone, anything."
