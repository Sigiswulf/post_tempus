#FIFTH FRENCH REPUBLIC
  POLITICS_FRANCOIS_MITTERAND_DESC:0 "It was all supposed to work so well. For a decade the Fifth Republic had dragged itself from one year until the next, mortally wounded yet still alive. \n\n Then the elections, yes, elections of 1985 had delivered Mitterand himself to office.  When everything fell apart at once, almost immediately after the elections, he could only wonder if there was something he could have done to save what little remained of the Republic. \n\n Declaring marital law amid the chaos of ’86 and ’87, and claiming emergency powers for himself, Mitterand had done just that in the decades since, holding the delicate remanent of the pre-war French government around himself, keeping what remained from falling into the anarchy that had claimed southern France. \n\n But that does not mean anyone holds him in any great regard. The presidential dictatorship wears on the patience of the populace. And the Normandy Expedition, the last act approved by the senate before Mitterrand seized emergency powers, grows only more hopeless as the quagmire continues. \n\n The fact that Mitterrand himself had escalated what was already the undeniable cause behind the present collapsing state of the economy and the escalating banditry in the South merely to appease the military has not been forgotten by any.  \n\n Not that he had any choice in the matter, for the ill-fated expedition into Picardy, perhaps the final straw for the Republic’s once tenuous hold over Southern France, meant that the Normandy Expedition now represented nearly the net sum of what remained of l’Armee de Terre’s elite forces, and the requests from Normandy increasingly takes on the appearance of diktats. \n\n Now, Mitterrand sits atop a wobbly house of cards, stuck in the middle, desperately grasping at every straw to keep what remained of the patchwork government of the Fifth Republic alive. And perhaps the writing was already on the wall. \n\n Perhaps the Republic was never meant to survive, and all he had done was to delay its agonizing end. "
#PICARDY
  POLITICS_FABIEN_ANCEL_DESC:0 "When the bombs fell, civilization and with it any possibility for a peaceful childhood were washed away under waves of flames. For those left behind in the ruins, life was a competition, a competition to see who could accumulate the most food and clothes, and the only score keeper was the hearse, dragging those who had failed. \n\n And amid it all, Fabien Ancel had clawed his way to the top. From a petty thief fighting tooth and nail to steal pieces of bread from equally desperate refugees to the architect behind the triumph of Metz, with that propelling him into where he stands today - the “Menace of the Lowlands”, sitting atop the final evolution of his gang of deplorables - the Black Horde of Picardy. \n\n To strike fear in all those around them and to fill their pockets with the glorious loot of their raids, such was their lot in life, and few in the bandit army would want it any other way. \n\n But Fabien is an ambitious man, one that cannot be satisfied with merely sitting atop a rowdy gang of bandits. If bandits could secure a state better than the regimes of old, then bandits should rule, and any who could overpower the other and take their loot deserves to lord over the others - after all, this had worked for him. \n\n And to Fabien, what worked for him, can work for anyone, anything."
#MARXIST France
  POLITICS_GEORGE_MACHAIS_DESC:0 " When the last soldier of the Armeé de Terre abandoned Southern France to its fate of anarchy, countless sought to claim it under the red banner. To Marchais, all of them are traitors and revisionists, lies who defile the name of Marx and Marxism to sway the people to their petty fiefdoms. \n\n For who but the Champion of Marxism could bring about true Marxism to France? \n\n But Georges Marchais was not always one among the countless states vying for supremacy in the anarchy. Once the chairman of the French Communist Party. When the bombs fell in 73, it had been scantly a year since his election to the seat.  \n\n Amid the chaotic aftermath of the Third World War, to preserve the fleeting stability in Occitania, a merger of various Marxist parties gave birth to SFIO - a name chosen at Marchais’s insistence, another militia group among many in the ruined landscape of France. Like many others had done when Mitterrand dissolved the Senate and seized emergency powers in 1986, Marchais led the SFIO into open revolt against the Mitterrand Regime. \n\n Seizing the region around Toulouse from the nonexistent garrison, the Commune of Aquitaine was proclaimed and Marchais made its General Secretary. The fact that the Commune’s capital was not even situated within the region is a fact best unmentioned, lest one tastes the fury of the General Secretary against those who dare disagree with him. \n\n To Marchais, around the Commune exists only treachery and betrayal, not even that, but actors inside of the Commune are actively plotting the commune’s - and his own - downfall. Despite the General Secretary’s best efforts, these enemies of the state continues to nibble at the foundations of the great proletarian state, and chief among them is Benny Lévy, once the trusted ally of Machais, now he plots the end of the Commune from within its very borders, and every day it seems more falls to his malicious influence. \n\n But he cannot fail, for to him, the hopes and dreams of France rests upon his shoulders, and he remains steadfastly loyal to Marxism, to the Commune, and to the dreams of a France by the proletariat, from the proletariat and with the proletariat."
