 absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
 absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "While some states in these dark times might be guided by the will of the masses or a cabal of military officers, others have gone back to the traditions of old to face an uncertain future. Just as the First World War began the death of the absolute monarchies of the world, the Third World War brought them back to life. \n\n Divine rule, cults of personality, or simply unmatched ambition have given a handful of individuals -and in the future their offspring- the power to rule over their kingdoms with no limits to their power. Their opinions are facts. Their preferences are law. And their commands better not be questioned. After all, the monarch is the state!""
 military_dictatorship:0 "Military Dictatorship"
 military_dictatorship_desc:0"Greece, Brazil, and Chile are just a few examples of military dictatorships before the West and the East tore themselves apart, and ever since they have only become more common. As governments collapsed and chaos gripped most corners of the world, military officers grabbed their men and guns and proclaimed themselves the sole rulers of their domains. \n\n Perhaps a sole general stands as the one true authority. Maybe it is a handful of officers all ruling as a council. There are even cases where several generals joined forces and now rule as equal dictators. Whatever the case, there is little to no difference between the military and the civilian government here. And anyone who complains will get a blindfold (sometimes) and be tied in front of a wall."
 theocratic_despotism:0 "Theocratic Despotism"
 theocratic_despotism_desc:0"Look at the empires of old and you will see a common pattern emerge. Romans, Japanese, and Egyptians were all ruled not by mere mortals, but by embodiments of deities (or at the very least people that called themselves the embodiment of deities). \n\n Theocratic despots are revered by their people not only as great statesmen or leaders but also as the earthly presence of a higher being. As such, their wishes are not only taken as commands but as commandments themselves "
 technocratic_dictatorship:0"Technocratic Dictatorship"
 technocratic_dictatorship_desc:0"Feelings? We care not about such things! Under a technocratic dictatorship, only facts, graphs, and expertise can guide humanity forward. Unintelligent and inexperienced politicians will never get a chance at one day getting elected only to ruin the well-oiled machine of a state. No, only experts who are studied in the most vital of academic, scientific, and technical fields will ever get a chance at becoming part of the state. \n\n The rest should do what they do best and just follow us as their shepherds."
 kratocracy:0"Kratocracy"
 kratocracy_desc:0"Do you want to understand Kratocracy? Well, I give you three words. Might makes right. A Kratocratic state needs no power over its citizens other than coercive power gained through strength and wit. The rules and what is acceptable are only so because those with strength declare it so. And if a citizen proves themselves more capable than the leaders and beats them, then the state now obeys them and their strength. Vae Victis."

 fascism_sub:0"Fascism"
 fascism_sub_desc:0"One would hope that the hanging and shooting of the man who coined the term, the destruction of most of Europe, the complete dismantlement of all states who practiced it after World War 2, and nuclear armageddon would be enough to kill this ideology. But sadly that isn't the case. \n\n Fascism has two main tenets, a promise to grant a nation a much-awaited glorious rebirth to return it to its glory of many centuries ago and a deeply ingrained Us vs Them mentality. Everything the state does is to protect us from them. Everything and anything, and we don't care if they were your neighbor two weeks back. It all is for the safety and glory of the Us."
 falangism:0"Falangism"
 falangism_desc:0""We believe in the Supreme reality of Spain." Thus begins "The Twenty Seven Points", the original Falangist manifesto. Now, unsurprisingly, this ideology revolves around Spain. Advocating for a return to the Spanish Empire of old and a strong government, intolerant to any attempt at separatism, communism, democracy, or liberalism, it is widely considered the Francoist flavor of Fascism. \n\n By promoting a strong Catholic and Spanish identity, it quickly rose to prominence in the chaotic 30s, before Spain was plunged into civil war. Afterward, it arose as the main ideology of Franco's Spain. And ever since the bombs dropped, it became the driving force of Spain's growing influence in Western Europe. For better or worse. Probably worse."
 corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 corporatism_desc:0"Everyone is born with a purpose whether they know it or not. The main difference between one's purpose in a corporatist state compared to others is that they simply tell you your purpose. Some people are meant to be farmers, some persons are meant to be factory workers, and some persons just haven to be the ones meant to lead. \n\n In a Corporatist state, every single person has a role to fill for thegreater good. Just like the cells of a body, every person has a job to do well. And just like the organs of a body that each have a different function, so do corporate groups in a body. So just work as you are told. Or not. We can always replace you."
 national_socialism:0"National Socialism"
 national_socialism_desc:0"Or as it is better known, Nazism. The ideology created by one of humanity's biggest murderers still lives on to this day. And just as the chaos and desperation of Interwar Germany caused it to first gain power, so too has the Third World War given it the perfect world to resurface in. \n\n The ideology proudly declares the supposed genetic superiority of the "Aryan race" as called by Adolph Hitler and calls for the Aryans of the world to rule supreme over or exterminate the "Untermensch". Hoping to return Germany and the Aryans to a vague and unspecified time of greatness and prosperity of the past while ensuring their "genetic purity" continues, one can expect the same from current Nazis as those that rose to power 70 years ago."
 esoteric_fascism:0"Esoteric Fascism"
 esoteric_fascism_desc:0"Some Fascists claim that their superiority over other groups cannot simply be explained through earthly means. No. For them, their superiority goes beyond both human knowledge and understanding. They claim that deep within their souls and the occult lies the reason for their supremacy over other groups. \n\n Just as how Hitler claimed he was possessed by an ancient Aryan spirit, or how American fascist Francis Parker Yockey claimed that separate cultures had separate souls and destinies, esoteric fascists justify their ideology with mysticism. Spirits, ancient gods, souls, and bogus archeology are all fair game folks!"

 stalinism:0"Stalinism"
 stalinism_desc:0"As the world recovers from one of the most devastating and destructive conflicts in human history, people have tried learning from how humanity defeated adversity in the past. Some have even taken notes from how a backward and mostly feudal country, quickly became a world superpower in just a few decades. \n\n Stalinism, as first practiced by the Man of Steel himself, is a variety of socialism defined by an authoritarian and socialist one-party state, a planned economy, and intense force collectivization and industrialization. It also places a high emphasis on the industrial capacity of a country and the output of heavy industries, treating all other aspects of the economy as secondary."
 trotskyism:0"Trotskyism"
 trotskyism_desc:0"It is only natural that now that the world is licking its wounds, people sometimes fantasize about the what-ifs of history that might have saved the world. One often wondered about alternatives: what if someone else besides Stalin would have taken control of the Soviet Union after Lenin's death? And often the man most people gravitate towards is none other than León Trotsky. \n\n Inspired by the ideas of the man himself, Trotskyism advocates for what Trotsky once called "permanent revolution", the idea that socialist countries must constantly support socialist movements abroad. Besides this, it advocates for a transparent one-party state, feminism, artistic freedom, and industrialization through five-year plans. (Yup, Stalin stole those.)"
 marxist_leninism:0"Marxist Leninism"
 marxist_leninism_desc:0"The words of Marx and Engels were once little more than just theory, and then Lenin finally gave them shape in such a way that defined the 20th century. And even after the bombs fell all over the world and covered the survivors in ash, many still followed the rule book of the very first Communist leader. \n\n Marxist-Leninism calls for the creation of a one-party communist state led by a vanguardist party that practices democratic centralism. Economically it calls for a planned economy and the workers owning the means of production. Socially it is a strictly atheist ideology and advocates for collectivism and egalitarianism."
 maoism:0"Maoism"
 maoism_desc:0"When Marx first envisioned communism, he predicted that the countries that would be the ones to adopt it would be the industrial powerhouses of Europe. He expected that the large working class of Britain or France might rise up. Never would he have expected that the first communist revolution would happen in a slightly industrialized Russia. And he probably rolled in his grave when it happened in peasant-filled China. \n\n Maoism rejects the idea that socialism is centered around the working-class, opting instead to put an emphasis on the peasantry of China as the main driving force of the Revolution. It also declares that even after a successful revolution, there still exists a class struggle in which capitalism will attempt to resurface. And all attempts of such must be crushed."
 baathism:0"Ba'athism"
 baathism:0"The Middle East, even if relatively unscathed by nukes compared to other corners of the world, was still widely affected by the Third World War. All of a sudden, the region, just as every other place on earth, was thrown into disarray. But this corner of the world healed faster than others, and so began flourishing the ideas of a Rebirth. \n\n Ba'athism is a nationalist Arab ideology centered around the enlightenment, rebirth, and resurrection of Arab culture, values, and society. It advocates for the creation of a Pan-Arab, progressive, one-party state. A Ba'athist state also has a socialist-style economy to some degree."

 religious_socialism_desc:0"While some socialists might only look back to Marx and Engels, others choose to go even further back for inspiration. They go back thousands of years, to some of the oldest surviving texts in all of history. Christians look back on the teachings of Jesus and his humble life. Buddhists look back to Buddha's enlightenment. Muslims look back to one of their oldest religions, Zakat. \n\n No matter the religion, Religious Socialism takes inspiration or aspects from religions and combines them with socialist ideology."

 social_conservatism:0"Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_desc:0"What did humanity have after the bombs fell? What did we keep with us when everything else turned to rubble and ash? Our monuments crumbled and our flags burned, but societies and cultures are more than just that. Our values and traditions still live on past the hellfire. \n\n Social Conservatism is an ideology that places great importance on the conservation of traditional values and traditions. Economically, there is no one clear doctrine conservatives tend to stick to, but a mixture of protectionism and free-market policies are usually favored."
 neoconservatism:0"Neoconservatism"
 neoconservatism_desc:0"When one sees injustice, what are they to do? Is it best to just stand aside and do nothing at all? Is it preferable to leave the injustice live and simply forget about it, turning a blind eye to it, or is it better to face that injustice head on. Can a nation truly call itself a free and democratic country without fighting to uphold those same ideals abroad? Neoconservatives will tell you, no. The key is peace through strength! \n\n Neoconservatism arose in the US in the 1960s as a reactionary response to the push for pacifism in international affairs. As such, it is inherently bellicose with a belief that military force ought to be used to protect national interests abroad. Economically speaking, most Neoconservative governments embrace supply-side economics."
 reactionary:0 "Reactionary"
 reactionary_desc:0"It is a well known law of the Universe that every action has an equal opposite reaction. Most people, however, believe this only applies to physics, while in reality it can happen in a variety of ways. One of the most peculiar ways of this is in politics, where reactionary movements spring up against change. In other words, these are the people that said rock was satanic.  \n\n Reactionaries are, as their name implies, reacting to a change to a previous status quo. Reactionaries in politics look to return a country to how it worked before a great political or social change happened as in their eyes the current system lacks something vital the previous system had."
#Liberalism

 liberalism_desc:0"Liberal Democracy"
 neoliberalism:0"Neoliberalism"
 neoliberalism_desc:0"What exactly is the role of a government? This has been an often asked question no one has come up with a definitive answer for. Some say its role is to protect the human rights and health of its citizens. Others might tell you that they must ensure that the people have the opportunity to live fulfilling lives. Neoliberals will tell you the government should let businesses do their work. \n\n Neoliberalism is an ideology that had a very brief life before the bombs dropped but is now widely practiced by many states. Its main argument is that the government should let the private sector constantly have a bigger role in the economy and society. Thus the government plays a limited role in day-to-day life, and instead lets and helps corporations take its place."
 social_liberalism:0"Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_desc:0"Sure, some traditions have been around for hundreds of years, but how good can they be if we don't constantly second guess them? As time passes, societies and cultures change and evolve, that is the simple universal truth. No society ever remains completely stagnant, and that is thanks to the people who slowly change it. \n\n Social liberalism is a center and center-left ideology that calls for a regulated market economy and the continued expansion of civil and political rights. Government intervention in certain aspects of society is common, yet there is also an emphasis on the importance of the individual. There are certainly far worse options in this world"

 constitutional_monarchy:0"Constitutional Monarchy"
 constitutional_monarchy_desc:0"It seems that even after London and Buckingham Palace have been reduced to piles of rubble, some ideas of the English still hold influence in the current day. One of these ideas is that which was first proposed hundreds of years ago by the Magna Carta, the Constitutional Monarchy. \n\n In such a state, a monarch may rule over their subjects, but their powers are limited and some of their responsibilities are handed to a civilian government. Of course, this means that sometimes monarchs can be mere figureheads in Constitutional Monarchies or they can play a prominent yet limited role. "
 oligarchy:0"Oligarchy"
 oligarchy_desc:0"If there is one truth about humans that has become quite apparent since the bombs dropped is that we hate sharing. And one of the rarest resources men hates sharing the most is Power. And the best way to keep your Power is to get together with other people with it and agree to not give one ounce of it to anyone outside the group. Thus, oligarchies are born. \n\n In oligarchies, all Power of the state is in the hands of just a few people, usually of the same social class. One-party states, councils of ambitious landowners and businessmen, aristocracies, or even close-knit clans ruling over others can all be found here"
 corporatocracy:0"Corporatocracy"
 corporatocracy_desc:0"It is no mystery that sometimes corporations make quite a lot of money. And sometimes they want to make even more, but some pesky law is in their way telling them they need to pay "minimum wages" and have "safe work environments". Well, then they go to a couple of their politician friends and talk with them about those laws. Soon enough the laws are changed and profits grow. \n\n Corporatocracy is a type of government where most decisions are made with corporate influence or interests in mind. In such states, one can expect the wealthiest corporations to have quite a big say on the decisions taken by the civilian government. And if their interests are put at risk or their influence is ignored, well, just look at what happened in the Banana Republics."
 republican_dictatorship:0"Republican Dictatorship"
 republican_dictatorship_desc:0"Republics are beautiful things, but of course, every government has certain flaws. While government institutions, voting, and divisions of power do exist in a Republican Dictatorship there are a few things that perhaps give too much power to someone. \n\n Nations that are basically one-party states in all but constitution, presidents that perhaps hold too much power or for too long, or perhaps even a republic led by a dictator can all be found around the world. But it could be worse, right?"
 technocratic_democracy:0"Technocratic Democracy"
 technocratic_democracy_desc:0"Who is better suited to lead the people? Well if you ask everyone then you would probably get a plethora of different answers, but the one common thread would be that the best prepared should be those that lead a nation. The problem with democracy is that sometimes people don't elect the best prepared to lead the nation. But that can be easily fixed. \n\n In a technocratic democracy, those that are elected pick experts from a wide array of academic fields to surround themselves with. These academic experts are then put in charge of helping those elected to run the country in the most effective way possible. Sometimes they might even propose legislation."

 futurism_sub_noun:0"When the bombs fell, the old world became piles of rubble and ash or famine and poverty-stricken lands. Some still cling to the ideas of old. Be they ideas of government, culture, society, or morals. The Futurists of the world reject these ideas and look at those who try to keep them alive with distaste. \n\n "If the ideas of old brought the world to its current state, then what good are they now?" That is the argument you will hear every Futurist preach. They instead wish for the future, for it is there that their glory awaits. And if they have to abandon everything that once defined humanity, then so be it." 
 esoteric_futurism:0"Esoteric Futurism"
 esoteric_futurism_desc:0"Some people look at the world and understand that there are some things that we as humans can't comprehend. After all, if you were to put a cat in front of a tv, its brain couldn't comprehend the images. The human brain, just as a cat's, has limits to how we can perceive the universe. Beyond the furthest of stars and in the smallest of particles lie the unknown humanity cannot comprehend.\n\n Aliens, beings beyond the comprehension of our minds, and powers far beyond what humanity will ever wield might be just a few star systems away. Esoteric Futurists look to understand the mysticism of the galaxy and the stars, and maybe even harness their power."
 apocalysm:0"Apocalysm"
 apocalysm_desc:0"When the bombs dropped, they didn't just destroy lives, fields, and homes, they also swept away the morals of man. And without their morals and the laws of old, some persons looked at the destruction and then proudly proclaimed, "Not enough". \n\n Those that live their lives through the laws of Apocalypsm search to accomplish one thing and one thing only, destroy. Do they, just as farmers, want to burn the crops of the last harvest so that the next one may grow more bountiful, or do they just wish to see the fire? That is an answer only each individual follower of Apocalypsm can find in their own heart."
 utopianism:0"Utopianism"
 utopianism_desc:0"The bombs took away many things from us, but they also gave humanity a new chance. Tabula rasa. Such was the state of the world when the bombs dropped. Corrupt governments fell, oppressive systems disappeared, and dictators burned just like the people they tried to control. \n\n Now, as humanity begins rebuilding, there is a chance to do better than those that came before. The new generation born after the bombs claims that the future belongs to those daring to finally make things right. No matter the cost to get there."

Our planet is now at the mercy of forces that come from the cold black and empty void of space. So as a curate once said, "God have mercy upon us!""

 feral_desc:0"What is humanity at the end of the day? Let's strip ourselves of romanticism. Let's forget about whatever we think make us special. Our languages. Our cities. Our cultures. Our ties with others. Our minds themselves. \n\n We are animals plain and simple. When stripped of all that makes us humans, we are no different than chimps. But what if we are not only stripped of our humanity, but also altered? What if we become stronger, faster, more violent, and changed to become something more? What happens when we, just as the animals around us, become feral?"

 eldritch_desc:0"What are the limits of the human mind? What, do you think our mind is limitless? You think there is nothing beyond our understanding? Please. Everything has a limit, even humanity. But what lies beyond our limits? What lies beyond the understanding of our senses? What happens when not even our most advanced computers and mathematics can make sense of the unexplicable? How does one explain the unknowable? \n\n We don't. It is impossible. The Unknowable has no shape, form or reason. Our eyes cannot see it for what it is. Our ears can't understand what it speaks. Our minds simply remain in the dark, unsure as to whether there is anything at all just a few feet away. Wheter we try and advance or go back, it doesn't change a thing. The darkness does not care for us."

 collective_consciousness_desc:0"Humans are individuals. A group, no matter how closely knit or with a similar mindset, is still made up out of individuals, each having a different mind and each sensing the world alone. We. I. Am not an individual. I am so much more than what humanity can imagine. \n\n I have one mind, seeing this world through thousands of pairs of eyes, sensing the world around me in a million different ways that are all turned into one. Each body I possess is merely a finger I can move around just as skillfully as any individual. I am never alone.We think, therefore I am."

 ultrastatism_sub_desc:0 "Can humanity be trusted with itself? Can our societies live and prosper on their own without anything to guide them? If the chaos following closely behind when the bombs fell showed us something, is that we cannot. When the great superpowers of the world collapsed, so too did their citizen's civility. So wouldn't you agree then, that only a State can keep order? \n\n Hobbes once envisioned the perfect state as a Leviathan, a touchless entity by its citizens who through efficient bureaucracy and control, ensured prosperity and protection for all its citizens in exchange of unwavering loyalty. Now that his dreams have become reallity, they are the nightmares of hundreds of thousands. The individual is no more, only the State. The State is the only thing that matters. And anything the State wishes, it will do."
 securocracy:0"Securocracy"
 securocracy_desc:0"Chaos engulfed the world when the bombs fell. Terror, worry, and dread filled the hearts of the world as the once civilized world dropped all pretenses and embraced the violence of the new world. It took years for the people of the world to once again be safe. And some people only managed to get their safety back in exchange for other things. Like their privacy and secrets. \n\n A securocracy is a state which is near indistinguishable from the police serving inside the nation. It is hard to understand just where the civilian government starts and where the black batons of the officers begin. Maybe there isn't even a civilian government, just a puppet dressed as one."

Oh how he must be rolling in his grave now that it is used as guidelines. \n\n Oligarchical Collectivism as a system expects complete servitude, loyalty, and compliance from a lower class to an all powerful upper class. It is a state that looks to grind away the individual and replace it with a docile collective. Constant surveillance and war are par for the course, but do not worry about it, it is just how things work."

They forget the crushing rigidity and violence of their culture. They forget, so now they try to imitate them. \n\n Ultramilitarist states exist for one reason and one reason only, war. Every single aspect of the nation, from the economic to the social and artistic, is all centered around violence and conquest. There is nothing else that matters.
